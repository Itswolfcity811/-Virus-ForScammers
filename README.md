I'm tierd of people scamming poeople.
So I created these scripts to install a python file that has no code and does nothing but scares the scammer.

Instructions: If a scamer emails you or meseges you trick them to click on the link below. I don't suggest clicking on it yourself though. All it does is installs a harmless txt file that says that a virus has been installed on their computer and to stom scamming or it will destroy the computer. In reality nothing happens if they don't but it might trick them to stop scamming.
