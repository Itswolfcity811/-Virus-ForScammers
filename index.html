    <title>Fake Virus For Scamers</title>
</head>
<body>
    <b>Instructions: If a scamer emails you or meseges you trick them to click on the link below. <br> I don't suggest clicking on it yourself though. All it does is installs a harmless txt file that says that a virus has been installed on their computer and to stom scamming or it will destroy the computer. <br> In reality nothing happens if they don't but it might trick them to stop scamming.</b>

    <a href="Install.html">Don't Click this link!</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Or you can go to tinyurl.com and make it so that they can't read the url that gives away the link</b>
